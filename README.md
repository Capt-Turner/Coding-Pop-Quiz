# Coding-Pop-Quiz (WIP)

Here is a short little in-browser quiz game to challenge your knowledge of some basic coding in html, css, and javascript.

## How to Play

Once you click the start button, you will have one minute to answer all the given questions. There will be (5? 8? unsure for now) questions total. With each correct answer, your score will increase. However, an incorrect answer will deduct a small time penatly. If you managed to answer all the questions, or the timer hits 0, you will be given your score and asked to save it with your initials.
